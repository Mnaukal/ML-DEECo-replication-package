# ML-DEECo: Machine Learning-enabled Component Model for Dynamically Adapting Systems

This is an accompanying repository to the paper *ML-DEECo: Machine Learning-enabled Component Model for Dynamically Adapting Systems* by Milad Abdullah, Michal Töpfer, Tomáš Bureš, Petr Hnětynka and Martin Kruliš submitted to SEAMS 2022.

## Contents

There are several folders in this repository:

* `ml_deeco` -- implementation of the ML-DEECo framework.
* `ml_deeco_example`
  * `simple_example` -- a simple example showing basic usage of the ML-DEECo framework.
  * `all_example` -- example of all predictions defined in the taxonomy (serves mainly as a test of the implementation).
* `drone_charging_example` -- the example showcased throughout the paper (with a replication package).
