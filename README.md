# ML-DEECo: Machine Learning-enabled Component Model for Dynamically Adapting Systems

This is an accompanying repository to the paper *ML-DEECo: Machine Learning-enabled Component Model for Dynamically Adapting Systems* by Milad Abdullah, Michal Töpfer, Tomáš Bureš, Petr Hnětynka and Martin Kruliš submitted to SEAMS 2022.

## Contents

There are several folders in this repository:

* [`ml_deeco`](ml_deeco) &ndash; implementation of the ML-DEECo framework.
* [`ml_deeco_example`](ml_deeco_example)
  * [`simple_example`](ml_deeco_example/simple_example) &ndash; a simple example showing basic usage of the ML-DEECo framework.
  * [`all_example`](ml_deeco_example/all_example) &ndash; example of all predictions defined in the taxonomy (serves mainly as a test of the implementation).
* [`drone_charging_example`](drone_charging_example) &ndash; the example showcased throughout the paper (with a replication package).
